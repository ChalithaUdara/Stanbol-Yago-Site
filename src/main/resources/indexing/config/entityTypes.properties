#NOTE: This configuration file can be used for both
#  * org.apache.stanbol.entityhub.indexing.core.processor.FieldValueFilter
#  * org.apache.stanbol.entityhub.indexing.source.jenatdb.ResourceFilterIterator
# however users need to consider that the Jena TDB ResourceFilterIterator does
# not support wildcards '*'. So the default configuration used by this file
# will not work.

#Configuration for the FieldValueFilter

#This can be used to configure specific rdf:types to be indexed. Entities with
#other types will be filtered and not be included in the local DBpedia.org
#index

#How to configure

#The key 'field' can be used to configure the field the filters are applied
# -  'rdf:type' is used as default for the field
# -  Only a single field is supported. However one can configure multiple instances
#    with different configurations in the 'indexing.properties' file.
# -  It is possible to use a full URI or prefix:localname for all prefixes registered
#    in 'org.apache.stanbol.entityhub.servicesapi.defaults.NamespaceEnum'

#field=rdf:type

#The key 'values' is used to specify the filter
# - If NOT present, than Entities with NO values for the field are filtered. All
#   others are accepted
# - The value '*' deactivates filtering
# - Multiple types are supported. Configurations are separated by ';'
# - It is possible to use full URIs are prefix:local name for all prefixes registered
#   in 'org.apache.stanbol.entityhub.servicesapi.defaults.NamespaceEnum'
# - null can be used to explicitly include Entities with no value

#Examples

#This deactivate filtering
values=*

#This activated filtering for Persons, Places and Organisation and also includes
#all entities with no type
#values=null;dbp-ont:Person;dbp-ont:Place;dbp-ont:Organisation;

#The following two configurations would only index entities with no values for the
#configured field
#values=null
#values=
