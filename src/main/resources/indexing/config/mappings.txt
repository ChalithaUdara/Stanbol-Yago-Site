#      COMMON ONTOLOGIES. USERS MIGHT WANT TO ADAPT THIS CONFIGURATION BY
#      COMMENTING/UNCOMMENTING AND/OR ADDING NEW MAPPINGS

# --- Define the Languages for all fields ---
# to restrict languages to be imported (for all fields)
#| @=null;en;de;fr;it

#NOTE: null is used to import labels with no specified language

# --- Define the Languages for all fields ---
# Uncomment to restrict indexing to a specific list of languages, otherwise all
# languages are indexed

owl:*
rdfs:*

rdfs:label | d=entityhub:text
rdfs:comment | d=entityhub:text
rdf:type | d=entityhub:ref
rdfs:seeAlso | d=entityhub:ref

# used by LOD to link to URIs used to identify the same Entity
owl:sameAs | d=entityhub:ref


# --- Schema.org --

# Defines an Ontology used by search engines (Google, Yahoo and Bing) for 
# indexing websites.

schema:*
# Copy all names of schema instances over to rdfs:label
schema:name > rdfs:label

# --- Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) ---

# A common data model for sharing and linking knowledge organization systems 
# via the Semantic Web. Typically used to encode controlled vocabularies as
# a thesaurus  
skos:*

# copy all SKOS labels (preferred, alternative and hidden) over to rdfs:label
skos:prefLabel > rdfs:label
skos:altLabel > rdfs:label
skos:hiddenLabel > rdfs:label

# copy values of **Match relations to the according related, broader and narrower
skos:relatedMatch > skos:related
skos:broadMatch > skos:broader
skos:narrowMatch > skos:skos:narrower

#similar mappings for transitive variants are not contained, because transitive
#reasoning is not directly supported by the Entityhub.

# Some SKOS thesaurus do use "skos:transitiveBroader" and "skos:transitiveNarrower"
# however such properties are only intended to be used by reasoners to
# calculate transitive closures over broader/narrower hierarchies.
# see http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#L2413 for details
# to correct such cases we will copy transitive relations to their counterpart
skos:narrowerTransitive > skos:narrower
skos:broaderTransitive > skos:broader
